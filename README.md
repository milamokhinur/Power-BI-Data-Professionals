# Power-BI-Data-Professionals
The project involved the analysis of raw data sourced from Data Professionals, representing individuals working across various sectors within the data field. The initial step was to import the raw data into Power BI Power Query, where it underwent thorough editing and preparation for visualization within the Power BI platform. The choice to utilize Power Query for data cleanup, as opposed to Excel, was driven by the desire to leverage the advanced cleaning features inherent in Power BI directly.

Upon cleaning and refining the raw data, it was uploaded into Power BI for visualization. The resulting data visualizations in Power BI Desktop revealed insights based on the participation of 630 data professionals in the survey, highlighting an average age of 29 years among participants. The global scope of data collection enabled a broad and generalized analysis, uncovering notable trends such as Data Scientists earning the highest salaries and a predominant use of Python as the primary programming language in the data field.

Surprisingly, the analysis indicated a work-life balance rating of 5.74, indicating a moderate level of satisfaction, and a similar sentiment regarding salary satisfaction. Unexpectedly, the data suggested that, on average, females in the field earned slightly more than their male counterparts. Additionally, around 40% of respondents perceived the entry into the data field as neither easy nor difficult.

The data analysis incorporated a filtering feature allowing for a breakdown of insights based on different countries. While the Power BI Desktop provided an overall view of general data trends, the ability to filter data by country allowed for a more nuanced and detailed analysis, offering insights specific to different regions. This approach enhances the project's comprehensiveness by providing a more granular understanding of the data professional landscape across various countries.
